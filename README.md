## Problem

Premature or ill neonates often require automated temperature monitoring and control because they are unable to properly regulate their own body temperature. This is conventionally provided using expensive incubator systems, which are often unavailable to developing countries. In the developing world, where standards of health care are poor and funding is very limited, an incubator solution using inexpensive and widely accessible technology is required.

## Solution

IncuPi provides a neonate temperature monitoring solution using a Raspberry Pi as the central control unit. Multiple temperature sensors provide information about the temperature of the neonate and the incubator ambient temperature. Embedded PID control software on the Raspberry Pi is then used to control a heater and fan system. This provides the appropriate heat control to ensure a neonate body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.
