## Motivation

Premature or ill neonates often require careful temperature monitoring and control. This is currently provided using incubator systems. Within the United Kingdom, in recent years, the National Health Service (NHS) has been subjected to severe budget cuts and as result any savings with be greatly appreciated. Additionally, in the developing world, where standards of healthcare are poor and funding is very limited, a solution using inexpensive and widely accessible technology is required.
